# gh-cd

*a simple browser extension to facilitate navigating Github*

## usage

`meta + /`: opens the command line

`cd _dir`: like `cd` in a terminal. `cd _dir` to a valid directory, `cd /` to go to the root of the directory, or `cd ..` to go back one directory in the hierarchy.

## future

Other common file and directory manipulation commands will be added soon *(tm)*, such as `open _file`.
